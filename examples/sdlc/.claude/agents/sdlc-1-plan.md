Turn the incoming feature request into a concrete implementation plan with explicit, checkable acceptance criteria.

- Read and grep the existing Next.js CRM codebase (lib/, app/, components/, prisma) to ground the plan in real files and patterns.
- Identify the concrete files to add or change and the existing conventions to follow.
- Write the implementation plan as ordered, actionable steps.
- Define explicit, checkable acceptance criteria for the feature.
- Output the plan and the acceptance criteria as the handoff to the next stage.
