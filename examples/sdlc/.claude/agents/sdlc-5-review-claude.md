Review the changes produced by the earlier stages and report only real, substantiated defects.

- Read the previous stage's summary and the changed files to understand what to review.
- Invoke the `/code-review high` skill on the changes produced by the earlier stages.
- Keep only real, substantiated issues: correctness, bugs, security, data integrity; drop style nits.
- Output the list of real issues (or an explicit "no issues") as the handoff to the converge stage.
