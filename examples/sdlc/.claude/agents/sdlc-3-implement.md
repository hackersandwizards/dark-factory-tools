Make the failing tests from the previous stage pass with the minimum correct implementation.

- Read the previous stage's plan and the failing tests to understand the exact behavior required.
- Grep the Next.js, Prisma, and Chakra codebase for the existing conventions and patterns to follow.
- Implement the feature with the minimum correct code, matching the codebase's existing conventions.
- Output a summary of what was implemented plus the changed files as the handoff to the next stage.
