Write Vitest tests for the behavior described by the previous stage's plan, in the RED state where they run and fail because the implementation does not exist yet.

- Read the previous stage's plan and its acceptance criteria, and grep the codebase for the conventions and test patterns to match.
- Write Vitest tests covering the planned behavior, one path per kind of logic: lib/**/*.test.ts or app/api/**/*.test.ts for node logic, components/**/*.test.{ts,tsx} for React.
- Keep the tests RED: they must run and fail because the implementation does not exist yet.
- Output the plan plus the new test file paths as the handoff to the next stage.
